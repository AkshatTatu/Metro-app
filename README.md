# Metro-app
*Developed a C++ program to calculate shortest routes and fares between Delhi Metro stations.
*Used graph and heap data structures to model stations and connections effectively.
*Represented metro stations as nodes, including details like name, corridor, and connecting lines.
*Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s, BFS, and DFS algorithms for efficient pathfinding and fare calculation.
*Designed an integrated metro map to enhance navigation and visualize optimal routes.
*Displayed total travel distance and fare based on calculated shortest paths for user convenience.
